Python inheritance is a mechanism by which a new class, called a subclass, can inherit attributes and methods from an existing class, called a superclass. This allows the subclass to reuse code from the superclass and also extend or modify its behavior. Inheritance promotes code reusability, enhances modularity, and supports the creation of hierarchies of related classes with increasing levels of specialization. Subclasses can override methods of the superclass to provide customized behavior, and they can also add new methods and attributes. Overall, inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that facilitates the organization and structuring of code in Python.
