In Python, classes are blueprints for creating objects, while objects are instances of those classes. Classes encapsulate data for the objects they represent and define behavior through methods. Here's a brief overview:

### Classes:
- **Definition**: Classes are defined using the `class` keyword followed by the class name.
- **Attributes**: They contain attributes, which are variables bound to the class.
- **Methods**: They contain methods, which are functions defined within the class to perform operations on the class and its instances.
- **Instantiation**: Instances of classes (objects) are created by calling the class like a function.

### Objects:
- **Definition**: Objects are instances of classes, created based on the blueprint provided by the class.
- **Attributes**: Objects have attributes, which are specific to each instance and can store data.
- **Methods**: They can call methods defined in their class to perform various actions.

### Example:
```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def bark(self):
        return "Woof!"

# Creating an instance of the Dog class
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 5)

# Accessing attributes
print(my_dog.name)  # Output: Buddy
print(my_dog.age)   # Output: 5

# Calling methods
print(my_dog.bark())  # Output: Woof!
```

In this example, `Dog` is a class defining attributes (`name`, `age`) and methods (`bark()`). `my_dog` is an object instantiated from the `Dog` class, possessing its own `name` and `age`, and capable of calling the `bark()` method.
